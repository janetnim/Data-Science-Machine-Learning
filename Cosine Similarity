# Lets find the similarities between two arrays by getting the distance between them

from scipy import spatial

a=([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
b=([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])
print(spatial.distance.cosine(a, b))

# the distance is less thus showing more similariry between the two arrays
